This is a free template you can use for make your personal CV, with just some clicks and no coding. And you can host your CV live on the web by whatever you want (Github Pages, Heroku, Azure Static Web Pages....). But my recommendation is using the Azure Static Web Pages, because you can host with no costs and have a SSL certificate and routing to your personal domain name.
The layout is very simple, the layout is of a landing page, only to put your curriculum informations. You can put many information as you want, the layout is responsible responsive and won't break.

## Configuration ##
