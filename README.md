This is a free template you can use for maake you personal CV, with just some clicks and no coding. And you can host your CV live on the web by whatever you want (Github Pages, Heroku, Azure Static Web Pages....). But my recommendation is using the Azure Static Web Pages, because you can host with no costs and have a SSL certificate and routing to your personal domain name.

## Configuration ##

To run locally you only need to have installed Node and Npm, preferably the newest version avaliable. Clone this repo and run on terminal:

```js
  npm install
  npm run build
  npm run serve
```
